# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

## Description

The goal of this project was to find the lane lines on the road from an image. The source of the images is a camera mounted to the front of the car. The lane lines were found using only computer vision techniques within the pipeline

## Summary of Pipeline

The following is a top level description of the pipeline used to detect the lane lines

* Color threshold mask
* Grayscale conversion
* Gaussian blur filter
* Canny edge detection
* Region masking
* Hough line transform
* Line filtering
* Combine with weighting
